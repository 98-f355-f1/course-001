## Study Guide #1: Files, Streams, and Sockets

Please clone this repository to work on the course. It contains some code
samples and source materials in the `samples` folder that are needed to 
complete the exercises. 

We also recommend answering the questions in 
text files as you work through them, so that you can share your answers
or get feedback on them.

### Topics and course format

Each topic in this study guide consists of a Practicing Ruby article to read,
some questions to test your understanding, and some project-based exercises
to put the concepts into practice.

All of the reading assignments have been made available from the first day of
the course, but the questions, exercises, and solutions will be released
gradually to encourage better focus in discussions around the course.

** Questions/Exercises already released:**

* Standard I/O streams and the filesystem ([PART_1.md][])

** Not released yet (except reading exercises):**

* Encoding and decoding binary files ([PART_2.md][])

### Getting Help

* For a review or to share your solution, open a pull request. We will not merge
it, but it will be used for commentary, and also marked with tags to indicate
its status.

* For questions or general guidance with the assignments, open a ticket or 
comment on a ticket that is already open. See closed tickets marked 
"solved" to see if your problem has already been discussed.

* Pull requests should be assumed to include "spoilers", issues should 
avoid spoilers unless they are very clearly marked.

* Once released, reference solutions will be made available on the 
"solved" branch of this repository.
