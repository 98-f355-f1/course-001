### Getting Help

* For a review or to share your solution, open a pull request. We will not merge
it, but it will be used for commentary, and also marked with tags to indicate
its status.

* For questions or general guidance with the assignments, open a ticket or 
comment on a ticket that is already open. See closed tickets marked 
"solved" to see if your problem has already been discussed.

* Pull requests should be assumed to include "spoilers", issues should 
avoid spoilers unless they are very clearly marked.

* Once released, reference solutions will be made available on the 
"solved" branch of this repository.
