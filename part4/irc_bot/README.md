## Solution to exercise for Part 4

---

**bot.rb** ([view source][bot.rb])

Provides all the code necessary to run the IRC bot described in the exercise.

To run the program, you need to set some environment variables, including
`IRC_NICKNAME`, `IRC_FULLNAME`, and `IRC_CHANNEL`. For example:

```bash
$ IRC_NICKNAME="yournick" \
IRC_FULLNAME="Your Name" \
IRC_CHANNEL="#practicing-ruby-testing" \
ruby bot.rb
```
